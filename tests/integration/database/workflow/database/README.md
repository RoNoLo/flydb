These tests should be executed manually !! one by one.
I used them to check the speed and memory consumptions of different method calls.

Because of PhpUnits nature some temporary files are used to carry over informations
to the next test.

This series of tests shows also what you can do with the json-database.

This series of tests has no query cache enabled.
